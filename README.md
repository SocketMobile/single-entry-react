# CaptureSDK React

This will be the internal repo to manage updating and releasing the React sample that uses `socketmobile-capturejs`. This repo corresponds to the single-entry-react sample on [GitHub](https://github.com/SocketMobile/single-entry-react).

## TODO

Incorporate CI/CD to manage building and publishing to Github.
